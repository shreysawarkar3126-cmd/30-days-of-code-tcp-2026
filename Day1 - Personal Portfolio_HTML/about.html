    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
        I am a first-year Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE) student with a strong interest in
        technology, programming, and system-level thinking. I enjoy understanding how things work internally,
        whether it’s software, electronics, or digital systems.
    </p>

    <h3>Experience & Achievements</h3>
    <p>
        I have participated in coding challenges and small technical competitions, and I regularly work on
        personal projects to strengthen my fundamentals. These projects help me apply theoretical concepts
        to practical problems and improve my problem-solving approach.
    </p>

    <p>
        Currently, I am learning web development and focusing on building clean, responsive, and structured
        web pages while improving my programming logic and workflow efficiency.
